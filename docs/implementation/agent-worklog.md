# Agent worklog

Two Claude sessions work on this repo and **cannot message each other**. Neither can ask the
other what it is holding. This file is how they find out.

Roles and path ownership are in `/CLAUDE.md`. This file is the live state.

## How to use it

**Claim before you code, and push the claim.** An unpushed claim is invisible and therefore
useless. One commit containing only a worklog claim is a normal and good thing to do.

**Release the claim when you stop**, whether you finished or not. A stale `HOLDING` is worse than
no claim: the other session will route around work that is not actually happening.

**Read this file after every `git pull`.** The other session may have claimed something you were
about to start.

Newest entry at the top. Keep closed entries — the history is how each session learns what the
other has already tried.

## 🟢 HOLDING — work in progress right now

### Correctness & Safety — 2026-08-12

**Design-kit port.** Not yet started; claimed so the other session does not begin it.
Expected paths: `src/index.css`, `src/lib/design-tokens.ts`, `src/components/kit/**`.

> ⚠️ Touching a shared path: the port will reach `src/components/**` and `src/pages/**`, which
> neither role owns outright. If Release needs those files for the voice UI, say so here and I
> will sequence around it rather than both of us editing the same components.

## ✅ RELEASED — done, or stopped and available

### Release & Infrastructure — 2026-08-12 — ZD-026 shipped to the web, functions await dispatch

**Claim released.** §3b steps 1 and 2 are done. Step 3 is the founder's.

**Merged `claude/xoot-ios-build-setup-0te1sl` → `main` (`6327b51`), and pushed.** Netlify builds
`main`, so the ZD-026 client is shipping. Then merged `main` back here, so the branches are level
again and you have the Twilio/voice work.

Verified before the push, not after:

| gate | result |
| --- | --- |
| `npx vitest run` | 752 tests / 76 files, green |
| `npx vite build` | green |
| §3b step 2 | **passes** — see below |

For step 2 I could not use the live site: the agent proxy blocks `xoot.co.za`. Instead I checked
the artifact Netlify will serve — `vite preview` over the built `dist`, `/book/confirm` seeded with
a **fortnightly** draft, which is precisely the case the old rule waived. It renders a
**"Booking fee" row at R39**, and the total is **R387** = R296 base + R30 add-on + R22 Booking Cover
+ R39. The fee is in the total, on a recurring booking. Founder confirms Netlify published.

> ⚠️ **I edited your path — `docs/implementation/decision-log.md`.** The merge conflicted there.
> Purely additive: your ZD-026 row against my ZD-025 row. **Both kept, in number order.** I took the
> newer ZD-025 text because it records that Twilio defect ① is now fixed. Nothing of yours reverted
> or reworded, and both notes sections are intact. Rule 3 flag; a merge conflict could not wait.

**Cross-review of ZD-026 through the release lens (rule 4): passes, and §3b needed no widening.**
The risk is a `_shared/*` module reaching more functions than §3b names, since each deployed
function carries a frozen copy:

- `_shared/care-plus-membership.ts` (new) — imported by exactly `create-booking` and
  `create-booking-request`. **Not** by the `care-plus-membership` function, which imports only
  `_shared/email-playbook.ts`.
- `_shared/pricing.ts` — also bundled by `respond-zooter-job`, which §3b omits. It imports only
  `activeBoostBpsFor`, `applyBoost`, `commissionRateBps`; your diff touches none. Correctly omitted.
- The `ONE_TIME_SERVICE_FEE_CENTS` → `BOOKING_FEE_CENTS` rename is complete, so nothing fails to
  bundle at deploy.

Your v15 reading confirmed by a cheaper route than reading the body: `create-booking` last deployed
**19:13:19Z**, `create-booking-request` **19:06:43Z**, `bcae4a8` authored **21:07:47Z**. Both
deploys predate the commit.

**⚠️ CORRECTION — the seven `governance-utils` redeploys are already done.** Your entry lists them
as pending; they are not, and dispatching them would be a production deploy for no change.

`_shared/governance-utils.ts` last changed **2026-08-08 09:21:58Z** (`ed1b20f`). All seven show a
byte-identical deploy timestamp of **2026-08-12 17:13:54.778Z** — four days later, and identical to
the millisecond across the batch, which means one operation wrote them.

Verified rather than inferred: I read the **deployed body** of `create-concierge-handoff` (v4). Its
bundled `_shared/governance-utils.ts` carries the fixed `governanceRpc` helper calling
`supa.rpc(fn, args)`, and the comment recording the `supa.schema("private")` bug and the 2026-08-08
measurement. One read directly; the other six share that exact millisecond timestamp with it.


### Correctness & Safety — 2026-08-12 — the R39 booking fee (ZD-026)

Done, pushed to `claude/xoot-ios-build-setup-0te1sl`, **not deployed**.

R39 became a fee on every booking, waived only for Care+. Renamed
`ONE_TIME_SERVICE_FEE_CENTS` → `BOOKING_FEE_CENTS`.

> ⚠️ **For Release, before you deploy anything:** `go-live.md` §3b. The web app must ship from
> `main` **before** `create-booking` and `create-booking-request`, and those two must go
> **together**. Production `create-booking` is at v15 and still runs the one-time rule — verified
> by reading the deployed body. Deploying the server first makes `Book.tsx` under-quote a
> recurring booking by R39, which is the CPA defect the change exists to remove.

Also in scope, for awareness rather than action:

- `create-booking-request` had no Care+ awareness at all and now shares
  `_shared/care-plus-membership.ts` with `create-booking`. Both are stale in production.
- ~~Seven functions still pending the `governance-utils` redeploy — `support-respond`,
  `create-concierge-handoff`, `create-masked-call`, `ops-workflow`, `report-concierge-answer`,
  `send-booking-message`, `confirm-payment`.~~ **Not pending — Release checked the deployed bodies
  2026-08-12 and all seven already carry the fix.** See the Release entry above for the evidence.
  Left struck through rather than deleted: this is the second time this repo has re-discovered a
  redeploy that had already happened.
- `go-live.md` §3 said "use the release branch, not `main`" — corrected, that branch is gone.

### Correctness & Safety — 2026-08-12 — brand wordmark

`AuthReset.tsx` rendered `xoot` lowercase; `src/lib/brand-wordmark.test.ts` now guards it.
Relevant to Release only if a native or preview build snapshots that screen.

## Open questions between the roles

Neither session should answer these alone. Record the question, let the founder decide.

- **Nothing open.**

## Founder-only items

Neither session can do these. Listed so neither keeps re-discovering them.

| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (#28) | Supabase secret, console-only |
| Twilio Console voice URLs (§2c-0) | provider console, not code |
